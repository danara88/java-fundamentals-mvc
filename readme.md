## Brief Description of the MVC Architectural Pattern 📖

MVC stands for **Model - View - Controller**. It is an **architectural pattern** that helps separate code 
into different components, aiming to follow the **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**.

---
## Benefits of the MVC Architectural Pattern ☝️
- More **readable** and organized code.
- Makes it easier for multiple developers to collaborate.
- **Scalable** code.
---
## What Does Each Component of the MVC Pattern Do? 📝
1. **Model**: Responsible for **communicating with the database**. Everything related to **business rules** and data **persistence** is handled in this layer
2. **View**: Responsible for rendering the **application's views**, such as an HTML page.
3. **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the view and the model. It **handles the application’s logic
   and validates the data entered into the system.**
